# BigButlerBattle
*A party game about serving the king while rocking a kick-ass skateboard.*

## About
BigButlerBattle is a split-screen party game where each player plays a butler skating around on a skateboard,
tasked with delivering various objects to the king. At the start of each game each player receives a list of objects
required by the king and the first person to deliver all objects to the king wins the game.

## How to play
The game is designed for controllers but works with a keyboard as well.
 - The left joystick / ad rotates the skateboard
 - Right trigger / w accelerates the skateboard forwards
 - The A button / space makes the character jump
 - The B button / shift activates a hard break
