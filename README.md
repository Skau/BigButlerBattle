# Big Butler Battle
*A party game about serving the king while rocking a kick-ass skateboard.*

## About
Big Butler Battle is a split-screen party game where each player plays a butler skating around on a skateboard,
tasked with delivering various objects to the king. At the start of each game each player receives a list of objects
required by the king and the first person to deliver all objects to the king wins the game.

## How to play
The game is designed for controllers but works with a keyboard as well. Keyboard can only be player 1 and all other players must use controllers (player 1 can aswell and the first controller will always be player 1).
